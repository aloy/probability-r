# R and Rstudio

In this class we will use [Rstudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/) as an interface for R. 
There are other interfaces available, however, Rstudio contains many frustration saving features for beginners *and* some slick features for more advanced users.

There are two flavors of Rstudio:
1. A desktop version that you can download and run on your own computer. 
2. A server version that runs in the cloud and can be easily accessed using a web browser.

Lawrence does have an RStudio server available for students enrolled in my classes, but **it is only available if you are on campus**. If you want to be able to work on problems while you are off campus, then you should install the desktop version.

## Installation

If you choose to work with the desktop version of RStudio, then you should do the following:

1. Go to http://cran.r-project.org/
 1. Select the link corresponding to your operating system.
 2. Download the current version of R (v. 3.2.1 at the time of this writing).
 3. Install it.
2. Go to http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
    1. Select the download corresponding to your operating system.
    2. Install it.

Once you have completed the above steps, you should be able to launch RStudio.

## Logging onto the Server

If you choose to work with the server version of RStudio, you can log on with your LU credentials at https://rstudio.lawrence.edu/auth-sign-in (remember that you must be on campus).
