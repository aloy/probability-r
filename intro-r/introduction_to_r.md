# Overview

One of your first questions may be why we are using R, a statistical programming language, in a probability course. This is a valid question, and below are some of my thoughts:

* R is one of the most popular languages for statistical programming. In fact, it is often referred to as the [*lingua franca* of statistics](http://www.r-bloggers.com/the-language-of-statistics/). I am a statistician, so this is one of the reasons that I love R, but that probably isn't very convincing yet.
* Probability is the mathematical foundation on which statistics is built. Some of you are taking this course as a prerequisite for a statistics course, so the using R will provide continuity throughout the curriculum. Additionally, since statisticians rely heavily on probability, there are rather "easy" ways to accomplish routine probabilistic tasks.
* R is open source, so you will be able to use it after you leave Lawrence.
* Employers are hiring R programmers and giving them fat salaries. 

Now that I have (hopefully) won you over, or at least have explained my rationale, let's focus on getting started.
