### Calculating probabilities

To calculate a probability based on a random variable, we use the `P` function
and define the event of interest. Below is a guide for defining these events.

Probability Statement   | R Code
----------------------- | ------------
$$P(X = 0)$$            | `P(X == 0)`
$$P(X < 2)$$            | `P(X < 2)`
$$P(X \le 2)$$          | `P(X <= 2)`
$$P(X > 2)$$            | `P(X > 2)`
$$P(X \ge 2)$$          | `P(X >= 2)`
