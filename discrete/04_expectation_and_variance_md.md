### Expectation and Variance

In addition to calculating probabilities, we will be interested in the expected
value and variance/standard deviation of random variables.

To calculate the expectation of `X`, use the command

```
E(X)
```

To calculate the variance of `X`, use the command

```
V(X)
```

To calculate the standard deviation of `X`, use the command

```
SD(X)
```
