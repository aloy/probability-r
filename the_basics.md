# Utilizing Packages

When you open an R session you begin the "base" set of packages. While the base functionality of R is still quite nice, you will often want to utilize functionality that exists in a package that is not automatically loaded. One such package is the `discreteRV`, a package that makes working with discrete random variables more intuitive.

```{r}
library(discreteRV)
```

```{r}
install.packages("discreteRV")
```
